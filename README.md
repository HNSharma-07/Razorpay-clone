# Razorpay-clone
A fully responsive clone of Razorpay website using Tailwind CSS only.

I have build this clone from scratch:
1. getting started with installation part of tailwind css https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss
2. set-up for font, images, color variables in tailwind config file
3. learning tailwind while building the clone
4. making it responsive
5. building the project deployment ready
6. deploying it to netlify app

the site is live on : https://razorpay-clone-tailwind-css.netlify.app/
